The pdb_and_Q1 directory contains the files corresponding to pdb ids and their correspondant Q1 value (these are the files generated by main_Q1.py).

The pdb_n_and_Q1 directory contains the files corresponding to pdb ids, number of residues and correspondant Q1 value. I.e they are analogous to the files in pdb_and_Q1, but they also include the number of residues of the protein.
