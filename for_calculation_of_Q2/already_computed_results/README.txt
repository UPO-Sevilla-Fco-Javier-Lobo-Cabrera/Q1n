The pdb_and_Q2 directory contains the file corresponding to pdb ids and their correspondant Q2 value (these are the file generated by main_Q2.py).

The pdb_n_and_Q2 directory contains the file corresponding to pdb ids, number of residues and correspondant Q2 value. I.e it is analogous to the file in pdb_and_Q2, but it also includes the number of residues of the protein.
